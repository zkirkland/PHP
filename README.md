# PHP

This is a repository for me to practice and learn more about PHP.

This particular project is a todo list where you can add and remove tasks.

You must have a database called "tasks" with a heirarchy as follows:

* db - "tasks"
  * table - "tasklist" with fields:
    * id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
    * task VARCHAR(255)
    * priority DECIMAL
    * PRIMARY KEY (id)

If anyone has any suggestions for improvements or perhaps any incorrect/bad practices I am using, please feel free to let me know. I am here to learn.
